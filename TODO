For words that don't match, print them out in a csv that can easily be edited.
Then I edit that csv and run the program again with the new csv added to the beginning of the old one, adjusting the number of words also.

For words that don't match, use lorem ipsum but as all caps to make it obvious.

Here is how I am running it now:
./read_check.lua --output_missed=true 3000 ./data/foxnews.csv ./tmp_override < ./data/fox_01.txt
